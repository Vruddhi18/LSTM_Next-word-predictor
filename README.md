# Next word predictor using Long Short Term Memory(LSTM).
This Dataset is from Kaggle:- 
## Overview  
The LSTM Next-Word Predictor is a deep learning-based application designed to predict the next word based on user input (a word or sentence). Trained on a predefined dataset, the model leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequence learning, ensuring contextually accurate and relevant predictions.  

## Features  
- Accepts user input (word or sentence) to generate the next word suggestion.  
- Built with LSTM architecture optimized for text sequence modeling.  
- Trained on a predefined dataset for reliable predictions.  

## How It Works  
1. The user inputs a word or a sentence.  
2. The model processes the input and predicts the most likely next word.  
3. The output is displayed as a word suggestion for the user.  

## Installation and Setup  
1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Vruddhi18/LSTM_Next-word-predictor.git
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the predictor
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
